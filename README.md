# Week 4 Challenge - Sam S

# Description

This challenge is to create a coding quiz from scratch, utilising Javascript to allow for user interactivity. I was able to get most of it working, except the rendering of highscores from local storage to the leaderboard. It's technically not on the acceptance criteria so I'm technically in the clear here (I hope).

Upon opening the page, the user will have a button to start the game. Starting the game will show a question, along with 4 answers and start the timer in the top right. Clicking a wrong answer will deduct 10 seconds from the timer and answering correctly will add 10 points and progress to the next question.

Once all the questions have been answer or the timer hits 0, the game over screen will appear and the user will be able to see their final score, and enter in their initials. They are then meant to be taken to a leaderboard that displays their initials along with their highscore.
